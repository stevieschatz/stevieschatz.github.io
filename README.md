## Experience

### Platform Engineer

As a platform engineer with a focus on internal developer platforms, I have a passion for building and maintaining tools and infrastructure that enable teams to build, test, and deploy their applications with ease. With over 10 years of experience in the industry, I have a strong foundation in cloud architecture and have a track record of delivering successful projects on various cloud platforms, including AWS and Azure.

One of my key areas of expertise is migrating on-premises systems to the cloud. I have led several successful migrations, including planning and executing complex projects that involve multiple teams and technologies. I have a deep understanding of how to effectively plan and execute these migrations and am skilled at collaborating with cross-functional teams to ensure that the final solution meets the needs of all stakeholders.

In addition to migration projects, I have also led the development of internal developer platforms from scratch. This includes building "golden paths" â€“ standardized processes and tools that ensure that all applications follow best practices and are built with scalability, security, and maintainability in mind. I have a strong understanding of the needs of development teams and am skilled at building solutions that meet these needs while also considering the overall goals of the organization.

I am also a skilled coach and mentor and enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. I believe that strong communication and collaboration are key to building successful teams, and I strive to foster a positive and inclusive work environment. In my current role, I am responsible for leading the design and implementation of our company's cloud-based infrastructure, and I regularly collaborate with other teams to advise on architecture and best practices.

I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry trends. In the past, I have worked on a variety of projects, including building microservice architectures, implementing serverless solutions, and integrating with external APIs. I have a strong understanding of how to effectively design and implement these solutions, and I am always looking for ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our platform.

In my free time, I am an avid learner and enjoy building home projects and experimenting with new technologies.

Overall, my goal as a platform engineer is to use my skills and expertise to help organizations build and maintain reliable, scalable systems that drive their business forward. I am committed to staying at the forefront of the industry and am always looking for new ways to improve the systems and processes I work on.

### Project Management
Even though I have been an engineer for most of my career, this hasn't stopped me from managing the projects I have worked on. Typically, always using Scrum and Agile methodologies. I have a strong track record of delivering projects on time and within budget, and have a reputation for being able to effectively manage cross-functional teams and navigate complex technical challenges.

One of my most notable achievements was leading the development of a new software platform for a large healthcare organization, which involved coordinating the efforts of over 20 developers, designers, and QA engineers. I was responsible for creating and maintaining project schedules, tracking progress, and identifying and mitigating risks. By adopting Scrum and Agile principles, we were able to complete the project ahead of schedule and under budget, resulting in significant cost savings for the organization.

In addition to my experience with software development, I have also led the rollout of several infrastructure projects, including the implementation of a new cloud-based system for an e-commerce company. These projects required close collaboration with technical experts and stakeholders to ensure that all requirements were met and that the transition to the new systems was seamless.

Overall, I have a strong background in project management and am skilled in using Scrum and Agile principles to deliver successful projects.
