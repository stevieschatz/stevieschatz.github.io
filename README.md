## Platform Engineer

As a platform engineer with a focus on internal developer platforms, I have a passion for building and maintaining tools and infrastructure that enable teams to build, test, and deploy their applications with ease. With over 10 years of experience in the industry, I have a strong foundation in cloud architecture and have a track record of delivering successful projects on various cloud platforms, including AWS and Azure.

One of my key areas of expertise is migrating on-premises systems to the cloud. I have led several successful migrations, including planning and executing complex projects that involve multiple teams and technologies. I have a deep understanding of how to effectively plan and execute these migrations and am skilled at collaborating with cross-functional teams to ensure that the final solution meets the needs of all stakeholders.

In addition to migration projects, I have also led the development of internal developer platforms from scratch. This includes building "golden paths" â€“ standardized processes and tools that ensure that all applications follow best practices and are built with scalability, security, and maintainability in mind. I have a strong understanding of the needs of development teams and am skilled at building solutions that meet these needs while also considering the overall goals of the organization.

I am also a skilled coach and mentor and enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. I believe that strong communication and collaboration are key to building successful teams, and I strive to foster a positive and inclusive work environment. In my current role, I am responsible for leading the design and implementation of our company's cloud-based infrastructure, and I regularly collaborate with other teams to advise on architecture and best practices.

I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry trends. In the past, I have worked on a variety of projects, including building microservice architectures, implementing serverless solutions, and integrating with external APIs. I have a strong understanding of how to effectively design and implement these solutions, and I am always looking for ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our platform.

In my free time, I am an avid learner and enjoy building home projects and experimenting with new technologies.

Overall, my goal as a platform engineer is to use my skills and expertise to help organizations build and maintain reliable, scalable systems that drive their business forward. I am committed to staying at the forefront of the industry and am always looking for new ways to improve the systems and processes I work on.
